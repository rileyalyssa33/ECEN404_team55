Week of 2/7
Inital Integration of Inverter with WPT coils as well as attaching to the secondary rectifier. 
Tested inverter at different frequencies to find resonance for optimal power transfer. 
Week of 2/14
Waiting on PCBs to arrive, start 3D model for housing and coil stand.
Week of 2/21
PCBs arrived, soldered and validated secondary side PCB. Waiting on primary side for further integration. Still waiting on the consensus on the batteries.
Week of 2/28
Tried soldering Teddy's PCB and discovered some shorts. Lusher approved a budget extension for a more practical battery. Waiting on Primary to integrate hopefully today.
Week 3/7
Fully integrated with a light load, having issues wih high current load. Trying to improve coils coupling to enable maximum power transfer. 
Week of 3/21
Primary electronics broke before spring break. I did some debugging on it but the small buck converter was busted. Focusing on finishing data collection for our thesis.
