Week of 2/7
Together: Tested inductors with inverter and secondary side. Initial tests showed some wireless transfer, and then at the advice of Dr. Moreira we tested at different frequencies to see how that improved performance. We were able to get the secondary side to integrate with the inverter and inductors.
Individual: Ordered PCBs previously designed.
